# Intro

This is the project for the upcoming website of the New Haven
Rubyists.

## To build site
Run `rake` in the containing directory. That is all.

# Notes
The 'graphics' directory has Inkscape SVGs with concept artworks.

# TODO
* Make 'Who?' section pretty with jQuery and some cool icons or something
* We're starting to have a few too many places to find information about the group.  It would be nice to have the website be a place that organizes all of the info into one place:
    * Add GitHub integration (see http://github.com/benjaminoakes/snippets/blob/master/ruby/list_github_repositories.rb) to show the organization's forks
    * Add Twitter integration to show our tweets (via RSS, JSON, or something else)
    * Add Google Group integration to show our discussions (there is an RSS feed)
    * Add Gravatar integration to show our avatars (see http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/hash/ and http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement for a gem)
    * If we decide to have one, add something to show our iCal feed
* Other things to think about:  a wiki, list of presentations, maybe a rotating member box (featuring a different member on each page refresh), maybe a job board...  lots of possibilities.  :)
