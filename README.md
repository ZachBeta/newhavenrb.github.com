# Intro

This is the project for the upcoming website of the New Haven
Rubyists.

## To build site
Run `rake` in the containing directory. That is all.

# Notes
The 'graphics' directory has Inkscape SVGs with concept artworks.

# Discussions
* What do we want the site to do (information to contain, etc.)?
* Do we want it to have server-side dynamic content?
* Etc.

# TODO

* Make 'Who?' section pretty with jQuery and some cool icons or
  something

* We're starting to have a few too many places to find information
  about the group.  It would be nice to have the website be a place
  that organizes all of the info into one place:

    * Add Google Group integration to show our discussions (there is
      an RSS feed)

    * If we decide to have one, add something to show our iCal feed

* Other things to think about: a wiki, list of presentations, maybe a
  rotating member box (featuring a different member on each page
  refresh), maybe a job board...  lots of possibilities.  :)
