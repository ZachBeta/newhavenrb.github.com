        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
          The first incarnation of Ruby New Haven manifested in 2008
          at a time when appreciation for Ruby was just reaching the
          community community at large. Over a period of two years,
          the group noticed that the New Haven computing community
          wasn't getting to love Ruby as fast as they should
          have. Luckily, an influx of Ruby fans led to the
          re-establishment of the group in summer of 2010.
        </p>
