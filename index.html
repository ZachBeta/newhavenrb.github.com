	  We are the New Haven Rubyists, a group of people living in
	  and around New Haven brought together by a shared interest
	  in the <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby Programming
	  Language</a>. We come from all different professions and
	  occupations to share our knowledge of Ruby and learn from
	  one another. If you're interested in joining us to learn
	  about Ruby or just hang out with fellow enthusiasts, follow
	  us on
	  Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/newhavenruby">@newhavenruby</a>
	  or join our discussion list to get in touch.

	<h1>History</h1>
	<p>
	  The first incarnation of Ruby New Haven manifested in 2008
	  at a time when appreciation for Ruby was just reaching the
	  community community at large. Over a period of two years,
	  the group noticed that the New Haven computing community
	  wasn't getting to love Ruby as fast as they should
	  have. Luckily, a recent blossoming of Ruby fans has led to
	  the re-establishment of the group in summer of 2010.
